# Final Master's Project - Breast Lesion Classification with GREP and LLM-RAG

## Overview

This repository contains the code and scripts used in my final master's project, which focuses on classifying breast lesions from mammography reports using two different methods: GREP and LLM-RAG. The project aims to compare the performance and efficiency of these methods in extracting BI-RADS classifications and breast laterality from a large dataset of mammography reports.

## Contents

- `scripts/`: This directory contains all the scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
  - `grep_pipeline.sh`: Script for the GREP pipeline.
  - `llm_rag_pipeline.py`: Script for the LLM-RAG pipeline.
- `data/`: This directory should contain the mammography report dataset in CSV format.
- `results/`: This directory will store the output results and evaluation metrics.
